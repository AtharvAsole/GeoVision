# GeoVision: Deep Learning-Based Land Cover Change Detection
GeoVision leverages high-resolution satellite imagery and the U-Net model to detect and quantify land cover changes across six key classes. It provides detailed insights into urban growth, deforestation, and agricultural shifts, enabling stakeholders to make informed, sustainable development decisions.
# Introduction
<ul>
  <li>Analyze land cover changes in urban, forest, and agricultural areas using remote sensing satellite data.</li>
  <li>Detect and study the effects of human activities such as urban expansion, deforestation, and intensified agricultural practices.</li>
  <li>Capture spatial and temporal variations in land cover through change detection techniques.</li>
  <li>Examine the rate and nature of land cover changes over time.</li>
  <li>Provide insights into urban growth, deforestation rates, and shifts in agricultural landscapes.</li>
  <li>Support sustainable land management by understanding land cover dynamics.</li>
  <li>Assess environmental health and contribute to conservation efforts.</li>
</ul>

# Dataset Preparation
<ul>
  <li>The study area is Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, known for its diverse land use, including urban, forest, and agricultural zones impacted by rapid urbanization and human activities.</li>
  <li>The initial images were taken at a resolution of 600 DPI with a 1:8000 scale and were large in size, so they were divided into 8 equal tiles to facilitate easier processing and analysis.</li>
  <li>Each sliced image maintained clarity while optimizing file size for effective model training and change detection.</li>
</ul>
