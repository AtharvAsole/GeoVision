# GeoVision: Deep Learning-Based Land Cover Change Detection
GeoVision leverages high-resolution satellite imagery and the U-Net model to detect and quantify land cover changes across six key classes. It provides detailed insights into urban growth, deforestation, and agricultural shifts, enabling stakeholders to make informed, sustainable development decisions.
